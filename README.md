## Aloha mai kākou

I'm [Zion Leonahenahe Basque](https://zionbasque.com) or rather [mahaloz](https://twitter.com/mahal0z). I'm a Ph.D. student studying computer security at the [SEFCOM Lab](https://github.com/sefcom) at ASU. 
My research area is broadly binary analysis, but my favorite topic is decompilation. You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RKZkfRQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
I’m also a previous co-captain of the hacking team [Shellphish](https://github.com/shellphish). Most of the code you'll find here is reverse engineering tools, research projects made public, or CTF education material.

Here is a pick of my favorite projects:


| Stars | Topic | Description |
|--|--|--|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mahaloz/sailr-eval.svg)| Decompilation | [sailr-eval](https://github.com/mahaloz/sailr-eval) is a decompiler-quality evaluation pipeline from the USENIX 2024 paper [SAILR](https://www.zionbasque.com/files/publications/sailr_usenix24.pdf). It also contains info on finding artifacts for the SAILR algorithm. 
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angr/angr.svg)| Decompilation | [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr) is a binary analysis framework used for a variety of tasks, including decompilation. I'm one of the core developers of the home-rolled decompiler. I focus on making the generated code better.| 
| ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mahaloz/decomp2gef.svg)| Debugging | [decomp2dbg](https://github.com/mahaloz/decomp2dbg) is an addon to GDB to sync decompilation, symbols, and metadata from a decompiler on-the-fly for the enhanced debugging of binaries.|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mahaloz/daila.svg)| Decompilation | [DAILA](https://github.com/mahaloz/DAILA) is a decompiler-agnostic plugin for integrating AI into decompilation. Currently, OpenAI and the VarBERT models are supported for various reversing tasks, like variable renaming.|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angr/binsync.svg)| Reversing | [BinSync](https://github.com/angr/binsync) is a decompiler-agnostic reversing plugin for cross-decompiler collaboration, built on git. Gone are the days of being unable to sync structs and types between different decompilers!|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angr/angr-management.svg)| Reversing | [angr-management](https://github.com/angr/angr-management) is the angr team self-rolled decompiler UI, which includes many plugins for interacting with the binary on multiple levels. Try it out today!|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mahaloz/ike.svg)| Education | ['ike](https://github.com/mahaloz/ike) is a prerequisite handbook for binary analysis written as a guide to prepare people new to computer science for [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), an automated binary exploitation teaching platform. Full site [here](https://ike.mahaloz.re).|
