I'm Zion Leonahenahe Basque, or rather mahaloz. I'm a Ph.D. student at the [SEFCOM Lab](https://github.com/sefcom) at ASU studying computer security. I‚Äôm also the co-captain of [Shellphish](https://github.com/shellphish). Most of the code you will find here is reverse engineering tools, research projects made public, or CTF education material.

Here is a pick of my favorite projects:
