## Aloha mai kākou

I'm Zion Leonahenahe Basque, or rather mahaloz. I'm a Ph.D. student at the [SEFCOM Lab](https://github.com/sefcom) at ASU studying computer security. I’m also the co-captain of [Shellphish](https://github.com/shellphish). I love binary analysis and exploitation! Most of the code you will find here is reverse engineering tools, research projects made public, or CTF education material.

Here is a pick of my favorite projects:

| Stars | Role | Description |
|--|--|--|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mahaloz/decomp2gef.svg)| Lead Dev | [decomp2dbg](https://github.com/mahaloz/decomp2dbg) is an addon to [GEF](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) for GDB to sync decompilation, symbols, and metadata from a decompiler on-the-fly for enhanced debugging of stripped binaries. 
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angr/binsync.svg)|Lead Dev | [BinSync](https://github.com/angr/binsync) is a collaborative reversing plugin for cross-decompiler collaboration, built on git. Gone are the days of being unable to sync structs and types between different decompilers!|
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angr/angr.svg)|Dev | [angr](https://github.com/angr/angr) is a binary analysis framework that can be used for a variety of tasks from static analysis to symbolic execution. As a dev I mostly work on the static analysis & decompilation side of the codebase. |
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/angr/angr-management.svg)|Dev | [angr-management](https://github.com/angr/angr-management) is the angr team self-rolled decompiler and reversing UI built 100% on top of angr. The decompiler features a rich set of research plugins. It's decompilation is getting better everyday! |
|![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mahaloz/ike.svg)|Lead Dev| ['ike](https://github.com/mahaloz/ike) is a prerequisite handbook for binary analysis written as a guide to prepare people new to computer science for [pwn.college](https://pwn.college), an automated binary exploitation teaching platform. Full site [here](https://ike.mahaloz.re).|
